# CheckCartQuantityM2
Test for Github Desktop
This is a Magento 2 module that allows you to limit checkout only when the contents of the cart are a multiple of X. This is very useful when you are selling stuff like beer or wine, where your shipping is in boxes with fixed number of items (for wine usually 6). You also have the ability to exclude some Categories from this rule.
